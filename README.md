There are three major steps in this program:
1. preprocessing
2. cleaning
3. apriori

the program takes about 5 minutes for preprocessing, but it only needs to be done once.
If you accidently deleted refined_dataset.xlsx, please uncomment regenerate_new_datafile() in main.py and run the program.

preprocessing:find unique countries, regenerate the data set

Result of the unique countries (call the by method find_countries)

cleaning
-
clean up extra characters in the data set, e.g., [ ]

files
-
all the files are under "files" directory.
- files/online_retail_II.xlsx
original file downloaded from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php?format=&task=cla&att=&area=&numAtt=&numIns=&type=&sort=dateDown&view=table
- files/refined_dataset.xlsx
the file that is generated by preprocessing process
- files/apriori_result.xlsx
final output which contains all the frequent item sets.
- test files: simpleTest.xlsx,Test_Retail.xlsx,testhalf_reail.xlsx
